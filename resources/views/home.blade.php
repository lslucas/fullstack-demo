        <h4>About me</h4>
        <p>
            Hello, I develop with PHP since 2003~2004, started with webdesign few months before that.
            <br/>I've worked with a vast kind of projects, since a simple CMS business website to medium port more complex ERP with customer control, finance and sellers interface.
        </p>

        <p>
            Nowadays I work in <a href='https://fotec.mx' target='_blank'>Fotec</a> where I'm a Senior Full-Stack Developer.
            <br/>Here I develop new endpoints for our API and implement new features to our customers. I also integrated some third-party APIs like Google Maps and made an algorith that calculate the best of our photographers for a specific order of our clients.
        </p>

	<p>
	    Whenever I got time, when not so bored by work I improve my Python skills while playing with Machine Learning.
	</p>

	    I'm a brazilian, but currently I live in MÃ©xico. Besides natural portuguese I speak spanish fluently, my english, besides few mistakes here and there I consider OK. Spoken english I got less practice, but I can understand almost anything very well.
