## About this project

It was made with Laravel as our backend. API authentication is using oAuth2 and the front for Github users with vuejs.
The pagination is a simple prev/next but it reminds where you are with a simple localStorage. Got next many times, look on some user profile or info and go back to the same page you where before, as it should always be :)
